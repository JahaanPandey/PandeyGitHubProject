#### **_Lab Assignment Two_**:
> The goal of this assignment was to demonstrate that we knew how to use the **RGB color mode** and **shapes** in p5.js and had at least some understanding of the **principles of design** we were taught in the previous lecture. We were to demonstrate this knowledge by **creating a composition that resembled "planets / outerspace" or "balloon."**
  
#### **_Lab Assignment Four_**:
> This assignment, unlike assignment two, didn't have us create a composition. There were three techniques we were to use for this assignment: a **mouse/keyboard interaction** using _mouseClicked()_, _mousePressed()_, or _keyIsPressed()_, an **if statement** using _if_ or _else if_, and a **loop** using _for()_ or _while()_
  
#### **_Lab Assignment Six_**:
> In this assginment, we were to **make a shape made out of other shapes, lines, or dots with a function**. That function was then **to be moved** with the _translate()_ function with _"unique x and y coordinates_" and **copied multiple times** using a _for() loop_. We were also to demonstrate our knowledge of _scale()_ and _rotate()_ by undating the function drawing, _angleMode()_, _push()_ and _pop()_, and _print()_. This was byfar the most complicated assignment out of the three.
